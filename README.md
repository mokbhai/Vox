### Model Options

Vox uses Whisper models with varying accuracy and speed trade-offs:

| Model | Size | Accuracy | Speed | Best For |
|-------|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **tiny** | 39MB | Fastest | Lowest | Quick drafts, rough notes |
| **base** | 74MB | Fast | Good | Everyday dictation (recommended) |
| **small** | 244MB | Moderate | Better | Longer recordings, better accuracy |
| **medium** | 769MB | Slower | Best | Important content, maximum accuracy |

Models are downloaded once and stored locally in `~/Library/Application Support/Vox/models/`.

### Languages

Vox supports speech recognition in 12 languages with automatic detection:

Select a specific language in Preferences or leave as "Auto-detect" to let Whisper identify the language automatically.
